This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Project Details 

The Frontend and Backend is created on Next.js except for the scraping logic . The scraping logic is rewritten using python and served using flask in a Docker Container . 
Right now the backend is running on an ec2 instance . A better option would have been to run it on aws lambda . Also the word count part of BeautifulSoup is not accurate would love to use spacy to improve its accuracy using nlp and tokenizing the words . Also inorder to improve perfomance a caching layer would be awesome as cache invalidation would become a headache as we need the latest data Iam avoiding it from mvp
Also Entirely client rendered applications would have difficulty showing upon the render
